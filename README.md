# scalar_order_parameter_ensemble_of_fibers
This short notebook compute the scalar order parameter for an ensemble of fibers (or liquid crystals etc)

You can find the definition and formula for this order parameter here:

or Larson's book- section 2.2.2 Rigid nonspherical particles:

Larson, R. G. (1999). The structure and rheology of complex fluids.

Input should be the unit orientation vector (p) for several fibers, a sample dataset is uploaded along with its screenshot.

Order parameter (ideally) should be 0 for an isotropic gel and 1 for a highly ordered gel.
